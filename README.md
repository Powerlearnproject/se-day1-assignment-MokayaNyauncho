#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. It plays a crucial role in the technological industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life e.g healthcare


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages 
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structured programming;
    It promoted the use of structured control flow constructs e.g. loops and conditionals and discouraged the use of "goto" statements, which led to more readable and maintainable code. This approach helped in reducing complexity and improving software reliability, setting the stage for modern programming practices.
5. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
    It introduced a set of principles emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility over traditional, rigid methodologies. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Requirements: This is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  2. Design: this is creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  3. Implementation: It is writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  4.  Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  5.  Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  6.  Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1.Integrated Development Environments. 
: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
2. Version Control Systems.
 : Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
-Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
-Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges:
1. effective communication.
2. agile methodologies.
3. prioritization of tasks.
4. regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is  crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt "Write about climate change"
Improved prompt "Write a 500-word article discussing the impact of rising sea levels on coastal cities in Southeast Asia, listing two recent examples of how these cities are adapting."
